Taurus (Python GUI library)
===========================

Taurus is a Python framework for control and data acquisition CLIs and GUIs in scientific/industrial environments.
It supports multiple control systems or data sources: :term:`Tango Controls`, EPICS, spec...
New control system libraries can be integrated through plugins.

For non-programmers: Taurus allows the creation of fully-featured GUI (with forms, plots, synoptics, etc)
from scratch in a few minutes using a “wizard”, which can also be customized and expanded by drag-and-dropping
elements around at execution time.

For programmers: Taurus gives full control to more advanced users to create and customize CLIs and GUIs
programmatically using Python and a very simple and economical API which abstracts data sources as “models”.
