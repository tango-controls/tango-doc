.. Guide on how-to install Tango Controls on Linux

Tango on Linux
==============

Binary packages are available for Debian based systems in the official repositories.
Use apt-get to install them e.g. to install the TANGO database and test device server:

.. code-block:: console

       $> sudo apt-get install mysql-server\
          sudo apt-get install tango-db tango-test


Python binaries can be installed from the official repositories

.. code-block:: console

       $> apt-get python-pytango

.. code-block:: console

       $> apt-get python3-pytango

**How to test that everything was correctly installed**


You have to have *"tango-test"* been installed and check where is it located (you can use *"locate TangoTest"* command) and start *"test"* command.

For example:

.. code-block:: console

       /usr/lib/tango/TangoTest test


You will have "Ready to accept request".

After you may go to JIVE and choose the following (see the img below):

TangoTest (it is a :term:`server <device server>`)-> test (it is an :term:`instance <device server instance>`) -> TangoTest (it is a :term:`class <device class>`) -> sys/tg-test/1 (it is a :term:`device <device>`)

.. image:: tango-on-linux/jive.png


Right click on the device and choose *"Test device"*.

You should get a new window with *"Attributes"* where you should see the values. That means you have done everything correct.
