* In the :doc:`Overview </overview/index>` you will find basic information on Tango Controls. It will let you understand
  concepts of Tango Controls and help dancing it.

* You may also start with :ref:`trying Tango Controls <howto_try_tango>` either with a preconfigured virtual
  machine or installing basic setup on your own computer.

* If you would like to install Tango Controls please look on :doc:`Installation guides <intsallation/index>`.

* To start connecting your devices to Tango Controls you should probably:

    * browse `Device Classes Catalogue <http://www.tango-controls.org/developers/dsc/>`_ to find device servers
      for your equipment

    * read :ref:`how to start a device server <howto_start_device_server>`

    * or read :doc:`development/cpp/first-device-class` and follow a guide
      :ref:`How to write your device class <how_to_write_first_device_class>` if your device is not yet
      supported by any existing :term:`Device Server`.

* To write your first C++ client see :doc:`development/cpp/first-client`.
