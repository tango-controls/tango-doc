End-user applications guide
===========================

If you are end-user you are probably interested in documentation for
:ref:`tools delivered with Tango Controls <tools_index>`. Below, you will find a list of tools a beginner user
usually needs to know.

Jive
~~~~
It is a tool used to configure components of the Tango Controls and browse a static :term:`Tango database`. See
:ref:`Jive Manual <jive_manual>`.

ATKPanel
~~~~~~~~
ATKPanel is a simple application which shows (and allows to modify or invoke) device :term:`state`,
:term:`attributes<attribute>` and :term:`commands<command>`. Thus it allows to test and control all devices in the system.
The tool is delivered together with Tango Controls. It may be opened as a stand-alone application or invoked from Jive.
See :ref:`ATKPanel Manual <atkpanel_manual>`.

LogViewer
