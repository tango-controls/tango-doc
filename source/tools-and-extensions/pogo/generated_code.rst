Generated files
=================

.. Note:

-  The source code will not be read when you re-open your project.
   Only the **.xmi** will be re-loaded.
-  Your own code must be added only between specific tags:
   On following example, only the grey part will not be overwritten at
   next code generation.

Generated code:
----------------
    - :ref:`C++ code <c++>`
    - :ref:`Python code <python>`
    - :ref:`Java code <java>`


.. _`c++`:

C++ Generated files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If no inheritance has been specified,
the generated classes will inherit from Device_4Impl (Tango-7.x.x or above).

The generated code structure will look like to the Pogo-6 code.

.. csv-table::

   " :file:`MyObject.h` ", "Containing created class data members and prototypes."
   " :file:`MyObject.cpp` ", "Containing created class methods for init, commands, read/write attributes, ....."
   " :file:`MyObjectClass.h` ", "Containing data members and prototypes for MyObjectClass.cpp.
   Containing also the Command and Attribute class definitions."
   " :file:`MyObjectClass.cpp` ", "A singleton  class derived from DeviceClass.
   It implements the command and attribute lists and all properties
   and methods required by the created class once per process."
   " :file:`MyObjectStateMachine.cpp` ", "Containing created class methods for the state machine."
   " :file:`ClassFactory.cpp` ", "Containing created class methods creating used class.
   In case of multi class server, add other class(es) in the factory."
   " :file:`main.cpp` ", "Start point of the device server. Most of the time, not touched by the programmer."

- A method called ``add_dynamic_attributes()`` has been added to the :file:`MyObject.cpp`.
  It will be called at startup to create dynamic attributes if any.
  .. warning::  It is NOT generated if the class is abstract !


     

     
.. _`python`:

Python Generated files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If no inheritance has been specified,
the generated classes will inherit from ``Device_4Impl`` (Tango-7.x.x or above).

The generated code structure will look like to the Pogo-6 code.

The python templates have been implemented by Sebastien Gara at `Nexeya <http://www.nexeya.com/>`_

+---------------------+---------------------------------------+
| :file:`MyObject.py` | Containing created class python code. |

.. _`java`:

Java Generated files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The generated Java classes are not compatible with the server API from TangORB.

They are compatible only with the new design from Gwenaelle Abeille at Soleil_.
See `Java servers`_

+----------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| :file:`org.tango.myobject.MyObject.java`           | Containing created class java code.        |
+----------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| :file:`org.tango.myobject.MyDynamicAttribute.java` |  Containing created java code for dynamic  |
|                                                    |  attribute class if any.                   |

Projects:
------------
    -  :ref:`pom.xml <pom_xml>`
    -  :ref:`Windows projects <windows>`



.. _`pom_xml`:

pom.xml (MAVEN) file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Pom.xml is MAVEN project file. It can be loaded as project by IDE (like IntellijIDEA).
* To generate this file, you must generate the xmi file in a path like *../../src/main/java*

.. _`windows`:

Windows project files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pogo supports **Visual C++** projects.

It will generate files in a directory name :file:`vcxx_proj` (where xx is the Visual C release. e.g. :file:`vc12_proj`)

Projects use the :envvar:`TANGO_ROOT` environment variable to find include and library files.

It provides 64 bits and debug/release modes for each solution.

In this directory 5 files are generated:

.. csv-table::

   " :file:`MyObject.sln` ", "Global solution project"
   " :file:`Class_lib.vcxproj` ", " Project to create a static library for the class"
   " :file:`Class_dll.vcxproj` ", "Project to create a dynamic-link library for the class"
   " :file:`Server_static.vcxproj` ", "Project to create a static server (using static library)"
   " :file:`Server_shared.vcxproj` ", "Project to create a dynamic server (using dll)"
