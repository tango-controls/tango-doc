Introduction to Astor
---------------------

Goal
~~~~

-  The first goal is to know at a quick glance, if everything is OK in a
   control system,
   and otherwise to be able to diagnose a problem and solve it.
-  The second goal is to configure the control system and its
   components.
-  The third goal is to have long term analysis on components (logs,
   statistics, usage,....)

Principle
~~~~~~~~~

    - On each host to be controlled, a device server (called Starter_)
      takes care of all device servers running (or supposed to) on this computer.
    - The controlled server list is read from the TANGO database.
    - A graphical client (called Astor) is connected to all Starter servers and is able to:
    - Display the control system status and component status using
      coloured icons.
    - Execute actions on components (start, stop, test, configure,
      display information, ....
    - Execute diagnostics on components.
    - Execute global analysis on a large number of crates or database.

    -  To control a host in remote, the TANGO device server Starter_ must be running on it.

   .. warning::

      The starter device must have a specific name to be recognized by
      astor. This name must be **tango/admin/{hostname}** (e.g. *tango/admin/hal*).

Running Astor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :program:`Astor` is a **Java** program using **Swing** classes.
  Classes has been compiled and the jar file has been built whith :program:`java-1.7`.
- To start the application, start the script file:
  :command:`$TANGO_HOME/bin/astor`
- **There are 3 modes to start Astor:**
   +---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Parameter    |   Mode                                                                      |
   +===============+=============================================================================+
   | -rw or none   | :program:`Astor` is fully **READ/WRITE**"                                   |
   +---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -db_ro        | :program:`Astor` is **READ/WRITE** but :program:`Database` is **READ_ONLY** |
   +---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -ro           | :program:`Astor` is fully **READ_ONLY**                                     |

Display
~~~~~~~

-  At startup, Astor display a tree where node could be a family of
   hosts (see Starter properties), and leaf are hosts where a Starter
   device server is registred in database.
-  The icon of the leaf depends on the controlled device servers status
   as the following definition:

    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | For Hosts                                                               |
    +=========================================================================+
    | |image1| All controlled servers are running.                            |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | |image2| Starter is starting  server(s).                                |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | |image3| At least, one controlled server is stopped and one is running. |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | |image4| All controlled servers are stopped.                            |
