Configure TAC for allowed commands:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+---------------------+--------------------------------------+
| |image2|            | The access control allows **Write**  |
|                     | access or **Read Only** access.      |
|                     | The **Read Only** access means:      |
|                     |                                      |
|                     | -  Read only device attributes.      |
|                     | -  Cannot write device attributes.   |
|                     | -  Cannot execute commands (a        |
|                     |    command could be a write action). |
|                     |                                      |
|                     | Some commands could be a simple read |
|                     | action.                              |
|                     | For instance on **Dserver** class,   |
|                     | the command **QueryDevice**          |
|                     | does not write anything and returns  |
|                     | the device list.                     |
|                     | This class is needed to establish a  |
|                     | connection between a client          |
|                     | and a device, and it is useful even  |
|                     | if user is in read only access.      |
|                     | This tool provide a list of allowed  |
|                     | commands for a specified class.      |
|                     | You can add or reove class by a      |
|                     | right click menu.                    |
